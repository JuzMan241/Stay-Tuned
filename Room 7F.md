## 7F - Mark of Secrets 

Mark's backpack rests next to the door adorned with traveling accessories. This comes with the standard explorer's pack accessories, as well as 12 rations and 8 gold (total). On the table, eight sheets of parchment are stacked and layed out next to a bottle of ink and a pen. A candle illuminates this setup at night. A little bag of sand and knife weighs down the papers. Next to the backpack, a scroll case holds two finished ink drawings of landscape. They could probably be sold for 5-25 gold each. This room effectively contains an explorer's pack and a scholar's pack. 

There is no book of lore present in the scholar's pack. There are only 12 rations and 8 gold throughout the room. The top piece of parchment in the stack is the start of an ink drawing.
