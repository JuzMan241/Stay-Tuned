She wears long blue stereotyped wizarding robes, which have holes burnt in multiple places, revealing a thin, tan fabric. Her silver hair is short, uneven, and looks like it has seen similar flames as her robes. She has a blindfold over her eyes and an owl on her shoulder.

  

A respectful scholar, dedicated to her research. She researches magical artifacts and how to make them, and destroy them. As she has come to this party to make "Connections", she shall refrain from focusing on what she does for a living, instead looking to hear about everyone else.
