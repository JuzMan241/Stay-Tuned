# The Fox’s Brew

She has a cart and horse, and offers the sales of simple-moderate potions, spices, and a low price on fox treats. She also sells fruit. 

If she is worried about a customer attacking her, she will feed treats to her foxes that offer their bites a very venomous addition. 

(2d8 Poison. Con DC 14 for half.) 

Trustworthy customers can buy potions that offer other effects, like fire-breath, or strength, or even the special fox treats.
