# The First Chapter

## Notes
-   The main idea is that the players are all drawn in to search a powerful crypt/dungeon, and trip a powerful magic curse that alters the fate of those affected.
-   The curse works like a black-hole in the weave of fate. It fundamentally alters how things surrounding it happen.
