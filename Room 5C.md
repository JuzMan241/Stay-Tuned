## 5C - Sheila 

Explorer's Pack is kept in the room (Backpack under the bed). No gold is present. The table in this room has four candles placed symmetrically in front of each chair. The only irregular thing about this room is a wooden staff placed on the bed. Every part of this room is perfectly aligned in such a way that creates extreme visual order. (ex. the bed is perfectly straight with the wall and the chairs are perfectly symmetrical around the table.) 

Very heavy sleeper, and is mostly oblivious to noise as she experiments with spells late at night. Will go to sleep quite a few hours after the sun sets, and wake quite a few hours after it rises.
