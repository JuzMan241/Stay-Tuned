A Pill Away

# Tour of the Underworld

## Intro 

Tour of the underworld is an incredibly simple quest designed to introduce some of the more powerful drugs within the universe, and Erarith.(edited)

  

## Background

Before the dance, Erarith's drug cartel has found a few basic drug components, and have been testing them to see what the effects are. Due to the incredibly volatile and dangerous nature of the components, most of the drug cartel is not interested in testing their own product. So, Erarith has come to the party with a bit of a side quest: get individuals to test five preliminary versions of their drug.

  

## Synopsis 

Erarith attend the party, and will attempt to drop hints of his business during playful conversations with people. To anyone interested, Erarith would suggest going to a private room to have some fun. Erarith would try to hook the player into trying the pill once there, and ask them to report the side affects once they are out. Afterwards, Erarith would request information on what happened. If they comply, Erarith would give them two silver as thanks and try not to find them for the rest of the party.

  

## Hooks 

Erarith hangs around virtually anywhere in the estate, and isn't shy in the slightest when it comes to approaching people. An incredibly simple way to hook into this quest is to simply bring up a fun time in conversation with Erarith.

  

## Part 1: Red or Blue, Neo. 

Erarith's goal is to separate the individual he wishes to test the drug on from any bystanders. Preferably, he wants a room with somewhere comfortable for the test subject to sleep, and somewhere no-one visits. A prime target would be a bedroom. He would offer to invite them to his, but would also accept an invitation to theirs. The Invitation While out and about Erarith would talk to people he believes are adventurous enough or savvy with drugs enough to be interested in taking one of his pills. He will target these individuals for his invitation, and attempt to hook up a meeting. Once they are in a secluded location, Erarith would give his spiel and make sure to inform the player of a few things. Firstly, Erarith explains that he has a few pills that he knows have fun effects, and he wants help testing them. He is asking the individual to help him test in exchange for some quick change and a good time. All he asks of the player is to take the pill and tell him what happened while under its effects. Erarith will also take a pill (Although it's the least potent he has) alongside the player. Erarith also notes two additional things: If you plan to cause trouble, then don't link it back to him. If you have things to do, then don't take the pill. They are a fun ride, but you don't want plans. There are five different pills, each of which Erarith has different priorities for testing. If he can, he will convince his test subject to take his highest priority pill. If convincing them isn't an option, he would let them choose. So long as they didn't choose his least priority pill, he wouldn't be too opposed to their choice.

  

## The Pills

The order of the pill's priority is as follows: 

1.  The eldritch pill. This pill is white with black and white lines streaking across a rough surface. 
    
2.  The psychosis pill. This pill is put white and very rough, but also very hard. 
    
3.  The blank pill. This pill is larger than the rest and all gray with a lightly textured surface. 
    
4.  The drowning pill. This pill is a light blue with a layered texture as if something was melted over it. 
    
5.  The calm pill. This pill is light green and has a smooth and silky texture. 
    

  

## Part 2: Tour of the Underworld 

Depending on which pill the player takes, different things happen. The effects of each pill are outlined under its title. 

  

### Eldritch 

The eldritch pill feels slimy as it slides down the throat. Nothing happens at first, but after a blink, the entire world looks as if you were gazing through a green glass. Then, a fog grows thicker and more towards the player until nothing can be seen. On their next blink, an eldritch deity appears before them. It is a writhing mass of scuttling tentacles, all crawling over each other and towards the center of a ball. Some fall off and drape from the bottom, like large, slimy brown worms playing King of the hill. Next, a slimy brown eyelid appears near the bottom of the mass, and the still closed eye tears itself a spot out of the tentacles. The eyelid then opens upward to reveal a brown eye with a green pupil. The glossy eye stares at the player. The nothing but darkness all around.

"You are calmed by looking at the eldritch horror, not that you could feel fear. You are made of gods right now, maybe you're made of this god? Either way, this is how you'll spend the next few hours."

  

From the outside of this trance, the player seems to just be unconscious for the next 1d4 hours.

  

### Psychosis 

This pill is incredibly powdery and begins to dissolve in the mouth. Nothing seems to happen as the pill is swallowed. However, over the next 1d4 hours, the player is going to be relentlessly harassed by slimy brown tentacles, green eyes, and a dark shadowy figure. These all manifest in the form of temporary apperations that appear on items closeby or held by the player. They appear only to the player, and only spawn when eyesight is broken with where they would appear. The apperations dissappear if line of sight is broken with them, or if the player attempts to touch them. However, the player can feel the apperations as if they are actually there, but any attempt to physically grab the apperation removes them from existance. The tentacles enjoy wrapping around the player or objects the player is holding, the eyes tend to appear in order to taunt the player for looking away from things, and the shadowy figure enjoys doing seemingly harmful or terrible things to other party members. None of the apparitions can interact with anyone but the player, although they can make it seem to the player like an interaction actually took place.

  

### Blank 

This pill feels smooth sliding down the throat, despite its size. As soon as it is ingested, the next blink feels incredibly heavy, and the player is immediately put into a temporary coma. The only thing they can feel before the white nothingness is their head falling backwards into a white abyss.

"For an instant, your mind goes entirely blank before you regain a slight sense of yourself. The passage of time here is incredibly difficult to tell, as everything seems to be slowed into a lull. Your thoughts seem lucid and dull; holding on to any particular one seems incredibly challenging. Perhaps if the peaceful noise went away, or if you weren't so lethargic, it would be easier to gage what was happening..."

  

The player's coma will last for 1d4 hours.

  

### Drowning 

This pill tastes similar to how water does. The flavor is slightly off, but doesn't taste like much. The pill slides down the throat fairly easily.

"Once the pill finishes falling down your throat, a feeling washes over your entire body, creeping up from your feet and consuming you. It's gentle, yet consummate, and feels almost like being underwater. Your fingers and toes all have gentle cool about them, and interlaced between them. This same cool runs under your arms and all around your body. Moving through the air, you are acutely aware of how the layers of atmosphere gently brush past and caress your skin. There is resistance in the air despite nothing being there, but at the same time, everything feels nice, even if a little strange."

  

Over time, this effect gets worse and worse. It feels more and more like the player is under water, making moving progressively more difficult, and the feeling of being underwater much more present. Things float into their hands, the air seems to catch them if they fall, sounds become muffled, and pushing through the atmosphere generates waves that they can physically feel. For this pill, other people can see the effects of how it changes the player's movement, however it is much more prevalent for the individual under its effects. Eventually, (After 1d4 hours) the water feeling will rise up to their neck and fill their mouth. They will not be able to breath, and will start to literally drown on air. They cannot escape from this effect, and will eventually become unconscious via drowning. As soon as they are unconscious, the effects of the pill wear off. It takes one hour for them to come to once again, and they awake with no injuries. 

  

### Calm 

This pill is very easy to swallow, and doesn't taste like anything. It doesn't taste bad, just nothing. A few seconds after you take this pill, everything feels quieter, lesser. Like nothing holds much immediate relevance right. There are probably people fighting, killing, and screaming right now, somewhere. Not you though. You feel an incredible calm wash over you with this pill. What you do with this calm is upto you, but it is, at the very least, a pleasant calm.

  

## Part 3: The After Party

All during the player's trip, Erarith will be keeping tabs on the player. Once his trip is over as well, he would seek them out if the player doesn't do the same. He would ask them to go to a secluded place, then ask for the description of the pill's effects. Depending on how descriptive the player's recollection is, Erarith would give them a better reward.
