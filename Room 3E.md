## 3E - Panaji Shasto 

A backpack with Brewer's Supplies, Tinker's Tools, Waterskins, and food rests on the table. Will start brewing alcohol after the first day. Bag of Holding containing a lot of herbs/spices, ingredients for brewing, vials/flasks, and miscellaneous scraps of metals pieces. 

The bag of holding is small, and designed to be strapped to a limb, rather than worn as a satchel.
