## 4B  Nexa Duskryn

On the table, a mess of ingredients and vials surround a makeshift alchemy workstation. A backpack also rests in one of the stools, packed with even more supplies for alchemy. If you were to search the backpack and room, you would also find a bedroll and 4 rations. 

A blanket is placed over the window of this room, and a potion is trapped to the door whenever Nexa is asleep. Nexa stays in her room for most of the day, but will go out for a walk around noon to meet her party members and grab food.
