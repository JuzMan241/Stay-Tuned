## Sparkles

### Intro 

Sparkles is a very short story with a very limited time for completion, in which [[29 - Sheila “Sparkles” Castmaker]] needs help finding all of the cats.

  

### Background

Sheila really enjoys games and is very competitive, so she really wants to win the tournament of the cats at the resort. She devises that in order to do this, she is going to need help.

  

### Synopsis 

Whenever Sheila and the Players happen to be in the same room, or Sheila is alerted to the player's existence via their flare, Sheila would offer her proposal and help. Then, Sheila would help find cats, rolling for what cats they found each day in symmetry with how many cats the players found. This would continue until they find all the cats, or Sheila is sacrificed.

  

### Part 1: Forming The Team

#### The Meeting 

Whenever Sheila and the players interact, Sheila is rather energetic, but not very good at holding a conversation. Whenever the conversation dies as a bit, Sheila would prop up her proposal:

"Hey, do you want to help me find all the cats? I promise it'll be fair. If you tell me all of the cats you find and their locations, all tell you all the ones I find until we get to the last cat. Um, please? I've asked some others, but no one else seems to trust me..."

  

Sheila will stick to her word, even if the players don't. However, if she finds all of the remaining cats, she will just go and turn them in, as she is very intent on winning.

  

####  The Cats

 Whenever the players find a cat, have sheila also roll a d7. This determines what cat she finds. If she finds a cat she already has unlocked, she will simply not have found one. Whenever the players encounter her or speak with her, she will make sure to inform them if she found any new cats while briefly speaking to them.

These are the ones she knows about currently:

Range- Confidence

Garden - Creativity

Maze - Cunning

Ballroom - Charm

  

### Rewards

 If Sheila gets top 3, she will give the players a gold and her thanks. Otherwise, she will briefly be salty and avoid the players. After a short while though, all is forgiven with her.
