## The Rooms

Arrow traps can be ignored by a person capable of dodging if: AC=DC+5, or +8 to avoid 2 traps at once. 

  

---

  

Every room, at its base, has a large bed that comfortably fits 2 medium humanoids and a small pet that feels obligated to share the bed. Rooms do not come with company, so you'll have to supply your own second humanoid and pet if you wish to put it to the test. 

  

Every Room has a round, wooden table with 4 wooden chairs. While food can be brought to the rooms, the hosts advise socializing in the proper dining room. A note on the table reminds the guests of this advice. 

  

A few sets of robes are folded on an end table by the bed. They loosely fit the designated guest(s).
