## 6B - Valenor 

An unlit lamp rests on the table next to a few sheets of paper and some ink. Some other supplies of a diplomats pack take their place in a backpack on the floor. A small sack of 41 gold rests on the table as well. 

The bed is made and tidy, alongside the other chairs in the room. The room smells of a nice perfume.
