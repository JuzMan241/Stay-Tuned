5'3". Her curly hair is tied back. She wears a hooded fur coat over her leather armor and more simple clothing underneath. A belt around her waist holds a dagger and a few tribal trinkets, and a red bandana is tied loosely around her neck.

  

Very passionate, and somewhat headstrong about upholding their morals when confronted in conversation. However, she avoids forceful conversation for fear of making others angry.

Does not like being alone. Starved for affection/acknowledgement of her own success. Also, her morals have not yet been altered at the party, and as such remain neutral good in nature.
