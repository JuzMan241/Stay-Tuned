# The Lurker of the Mist

A thick mist rolls, miles wide. Gradually at first, but it encompasses everything after an hour, making it near impossible to see more than a few hundred feet. Dry lightning occasionally lights up the fog, silhouetting nearby mountains and trees in an eerie glow. But then, you notice it. What at first seemed to be a mountain, is so much more, and so much worse. A mountain with legs. Hundreds of them. Massive spindly spikes carrying a monstrous worm-like beast. It didn’t raise much alarm with the first flash of lightning, but at the second, you saw it clearly. It moved.

  

It’s probably time to go.
