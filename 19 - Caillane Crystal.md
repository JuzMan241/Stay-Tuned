â™€ - 100,82,38

Small elf with a white mohawk. She wears baggy pants and leather greaves. A silver necklace lies under her black crop top. Despite being feminine, she is rather muscular.

  

"I must be better, so that one day, I can give back to those who have been so gracious to me." Caillyn is always trying to improve herself. She is incredibly loyal and thankful to her friends and believes that their love is a gift she should cherish.

She loves advice, although she is a little naive and takes nothing with a grain of salt. Overall though, she is rather excited to adventure and happy to receive criticism.
