## 3B - Murlock Maxis 

On the table, a few empty bottles of ale (and one unopened one) lay unorganized on the table. The unopened bottle is the only one not knocked over. Murlock's backpack and leather armor take their rest in two chairs pushed under the table as well. Their backpack has 14 gold and 6 rations.
