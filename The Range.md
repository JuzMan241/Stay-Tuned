In the range, targets are hoisted on trees without branches and various other means at various distances. All of the targets are visible from the horse track, as a section between the two has been cleared of trees for easy access. To the left of the main shooting area, there is a small roofed seating area that contains various different weapons to use in the range. Part of the horse track loops back around in this area so that multiple shooting runs can be made by horseback. A guard also stands watch in this area, mainly to prevent injuries and theft.
