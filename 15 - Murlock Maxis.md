# 15 - Murlock Maxis

Fighter

Hill-Dwarf

26

~♂ - 48,51,60

Rather thin dwarf, yet still well built. Sports a swashbuckling hat and rapier. Has a musketeer mustache and beard and assumes a very proud stance.

  

Murlock lives without a plan, and instead carefully considers things in each moment when they become relevant. Although his emotions and intentions are turbulent, he always holds his friends and responsibilities as his first priority and often clings to them.

However confident he may present himself as, he is very agreeable until violence is necessary.
