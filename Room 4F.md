## 4F - Billy Sunshine (Colmax Xadowblayde) 

A backpack containing 21 gold and a burglars pack would rest on a chair under the table. This same table would have a knife stuck into it and a few dirty plates. 

Colmax does not like anyone coming into his room, and would refuse maid services. Colmax is rarely ever in his room, and can only be found here early in the morning catching a quick nap.
