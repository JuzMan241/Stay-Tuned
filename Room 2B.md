## 2B - Dan 

A backpack on the table contains 40 rations and sits next to a greataxe. Separate camping equipment is arranged neatly on the floor. This includes a tent, some blankets, and some general equipment (firestarter, mess kit, block and tackle ect.) kept in a sack. 

Alex typically sleeps in Dan's room, but she doesn't like to store her items there except at night.
