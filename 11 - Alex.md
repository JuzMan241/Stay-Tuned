Alex Warlock

Half-Elf

15.5

♂ <- ♀ 85,13,38

Short "boi" that wears the green cloak of a person much larger than them. Under the cloak, she wears a backpack and belt with a light assortment of traveling necessities. The hood usually droops over her face so it can't be seen. If her body or face are observed, then multiple burn and laceration scars can be seen. She also has very short hair.

  

Socially awkward child that loves the attention of others but is too scared to speak up properly or start conversations. Instead, she interacts with people nonverbally and with magic. However, she is very distrustful and will attempt to convince others that she is evil, in an attempt to weed out anyone that will not like her. If she can't convince someone she is evil, she will become comfortable enough to speak to that person and cling to them.

Her patron encourages her to act evil and trick people with magic. She is rather uncomfortable about people seeing her body and face, and doesn't talk in front of people she doesn't know.
