# Unto Savia

  

## Introduction

"Every adventure starts somewhere. Our story begins in the town of... wait, this isn't a town? It's a whole province? Who's idea was that!" 

  

This is the first part of session zero where players will learn about the locations of Bagus for context in their backstories.

  

## Background

The Elanor family estate is located within Bagus, which is why it is so important for the adventurers to have ties here. By acting in and around Bagus, the Elanor family has a much higher likelihood of noticing them, as their family diplomats have eyes and ears all around the province.

  

## Synopsis

Before session 0 starts, the players should be informed to be prepared with enough information about their character to share the general gist for who they are and how to get along with them. Next, the background/overview of Bagus will be read to set the scene for the campaign, then each character will be briefly introduced and given information about locations in Bagus to help flesh out their character and understand who they are.

Once questions are over and all characters have been introduced, "Before The Dance" begins.

  

## Part 1: Lay of the Land

First, read or paraphrase the overview of the region. Only address the individual settlements if there are questions or more details asked about them. 

  

### Overview of Bagus

“The starting province of the campaign, Bagus, is a location within the greater confederacy of Savia. Either by living in, living nearby, or passing through Bagus, your characters would at minimum know the following of the general area:

In Bagus, the morning sun rises in the east over the sweeping mountains of the province. Hiding on one side of these eastern mountains, the tiny settlement of Accospenovi shelters from the savannah and desert the mountain separates it from. In their hidden hamlet, denizens of this town use what little land they have to eke out a modest living.

Moving west from these arid environments, the climate gets much more tropical in Eliaquentia and Auliobre. These two towns work in unison; Auliobrie provides wood, wheat, and workers to Eliaquentia. In turn, Eliaquentia sells their goods to the tradeway they sit on.

Following this tradeway north, you would find yourself further into the forests of Bagus. Here, the towns of Pollum and Cantia produce the province's wood and minerals, shipping it on the tradeway to Cancovo, the port of the province, or Retoria, the province capitol. Cancovo sits on the southern shore, and Retoria safely sits into the northern mountains with vast grassy farmland to its south, and massive forests to its north. Naturally, Retoria is a massive influence of trade and power in the region, and it's trade district is envied across the entire nation.

Although their army is one of the greatest in the world, Savia's forces are stretched across the largest nation in the land. Natives of the land often have difficulty finding military officials willing to diverge forces to minor problems in the region. As such, Savia (and Bagus specifically, being a border province) are fantastic places for adventures to find work.”

  

### Places in Bagus

-   #### [[Retoria]]
    
-   #### [[Cancovo]]
    
-   #### [[Cantia]]
    
-   #### [[Elliaquentia and Auliobrie]]
    
-   #### [[Accospenovi]]
    

  

## Part 2: Unto Savia

After reading through the overview of Bagus, read or paraphrase the following:

“Now, for some reason or another, each of you have found your way to Savia, and the province of Bagus. Perhaps your character is a traveling merchant, who often seeks to sell goods in the vast trading hub of Retoria. Maybe you are a sailor based in Cancovo, or a simple farmer or lumberjack. They could even be a thief who uses the lack of protection on the open roads to your advantage. Or, you could be among the guards and heroes working to stop them. So, as a group, let's figure out why! We'll go down the line, and each character will introduce themselves with what you have already been asked to prepare, and we can work individually, or as a group to get ideas for your character. At this point, group discussion for each character is greatly encouraged, as well as questions about the province or specific locations. If secrets need to be DMed though, feel free to shoot either Krow or me a message, and one of us will break off to deal with your character individually.”

  

For us, (the DMs), the goal is to answer questions and establish the setting in which each character lives and some reasons for why they would receive a letter. The characters don't necessarily have to be from Bagus or Savia, so exceptions can be made for that. However, they need a good reason to be noticed outside of Bagus, because it is far easier for the Elanor family to find adventurers in Bagus than anywhere else. Regardless, focus on one character at a time (hopefully involving everyone), then move on to the next. Once each character has been addressed, we move into "Before the Dance" where the letter is actually received.

# Before The Dance  
  

## Introduction

This part of session 0 focuses on the letter each individual receives, and how they take the trip to family Elanor's resort.

  

## Background

Travis' Inn and Travels is a well known travel company in Bagus. Because of this, the Elanor family decided to hire their services for a few days in order to pick up any travels from virtually any town, and bring them to Retoria, and subsequently the estate.

  

## Synopsis

Each player receives an ambiguous package containing a letter and ticket of transport in order to reach the Elanor family estate. The letter instructs players to travel to a specific pickup location. A horse drawn carriage will be waiting for them at the location, and will take them to an inn in Retoria (if they aren't already there). Once in Retoria, the players have one and a half hours to spend in town (or at the inn) before the next carriage arrives. At the Inn, the players have a chance to meet Jonathon, Panaji, and Caillane before they set out towards the estate with them.

  

## Hooks

The goal of this part of the story is to get everyone on their way to attending the party. The intended way for this to happen is each of the invited guests (including the players) will receive a letter. This letter is either hand delivered or left at the residence of the attending individual. Guests are also allowed to bring a plus one, so this could be an option for someone to attend, should the players form attachments in their backstory that would make something like this feasible or practical.

  

## Part 1: The Letters

So, for some reason or another, each of the players receive their letter. Each letter comes in a sealed envelope, with their name on the front, and their number on the back; both in ink. Opening up the envelope, the letter is also accompanied by a red ticket. 

  

### The letter reads as follows:

“Dear Recipient Number [x], On behalf of the Eleanor Family of Savia, you are invited to enjoy a 7-day vacation at our resort estate. Included with this letter, you should have received a red ticket. Use of this ticket grants you a free carriage ride for yourself and one other person, should you so choose, to bring to our resort. You were chosen for this invitation because you show promise that you will rise in history. We invite you to this gathering filled with other individuals who share similar inspiring traits. If you arrive at the closest carriage pickup in {Applicable Town} tomorrow at noon, you will arrive just before the events start. Your carriage will be waiting for you there behind Travis' Inn And Travels. Please bring your letter and ticket with you. Thank you in advance for your attendance.”

  

### For reference, the recipients numbers and character names are here:

- [[The Player’s Rooms (Legacy)]]
  

### The Ticket

On the front of the red ticket, bold print spells "Travis' Transport" above the logo of a horse-drawn carriage. Flipping the ticket over, it says "Prepaid Pass. 1 Ride for two, destination: Retoria."

  

Most of the characters should be familiar with Travis' Inn and Travels, as it is a fairly large Retoria-based business that runs in virtually every town here. This may add to the credibility of the letter, which could be useful for enticing players to follow the letter. Unfortunately, this section is rather railroaded, but some convincing should get the players on the right track. When the players choose to head to the closest location, their travels go without encounters. The trek there is peaceful and rather uneventful.

  

## Part 2: Travis' Inn and Travels 

The layout of every Travis Inn is the exact same, so you can use the same description for each. As the players approach an inn, read or paraphrase the following.

This inn is exactly what you would expect when you hear, "Stereotypically DND Inn". A sign hanging from the front porch sports the same logo you saw on your ticket, but this time it's accompanied by a large pictorial of ale.

When players enter an inn, read or paraphrase the following.

“Entering the inn, you take note of the layout. It's a standard Travis Inn. The bar is to the left of the entrance towards the back of the Inn, and tables are scattered out in front of it. Stairs are visible through a doorway to the left of the bar. To the back of the inn, a marked door leads out to the ‘Travel’ section of this establishment.”

  

Entering the bar, a barmaid would notice the player and come over, asking if they are here for the ride. The barmaid would direct the player to the door if they answer yes, saying that the carriage is waiting outside for them. 

If the players question the barmaid, she was merely instructed by the Elanor family to direct any seeming adventurers to the location of transport. 

  

When the players leave the inn via the back, read or paraphrase the following.

“Exiting the inn, the distinct smell of horse hits your nose, as does the image of a carriage directly in front of you. It sits on a dirt road leading back to the road from which you came. A husky looking man sits on the front of the carriage, and notices your arrival. He greets you with a smile, and asks for your ticket.”

  

The man will check the validity of the ticket using magic when he is handed it. After validating it's integrity, the man says something similar to, "Yup, the tickets legit. You're good to go then. If you hop on in the back, then I'll take you to Travis' Inn in Retoria." If questioned further, his answer will be similar to that of the barmaid. The Elanor family arranged for their inn to transport adventurers with the ticket that they already paid for them. Once they get into the carriage, that character's scene fades to black, and we work on the next character. Repeat these encounters for each player, changing things when needed and summarizing info that has already been covered.

##   
Part 3: Retoria

Once all the players are in the carriage, read or paraphrase the following:

So, all of you then have set off towards Retoria, the capital of the province. The ride is mostly pleasant, although a little bumpy. The scenery along the way is nice, if you spend any time observing it. Much of the landscapes of Bagus are mostly untouched, and an uneventful ride lets you truly appreciate most of it even from the path of the tradeway. For some of you this journey will take days, for others it will only take hours. Eventually though, each of your travels brings you to the city of Retoria. It's walls stand vigilant as you approach, barely covering the rooftops of the buildings inside. Soon enough, all of your carriages pass through the walls after being briefly stopped at the gate. In about ten minutes, the carriage fully stops, and each of your drivers call out from the front to you, "Well, we're here! You're at Travis' Inn in Retoria. On behalf of the Elanor family, we hope the ride was enjoyable and pleasant. We also wish to inform you to check with the innkeeper here to figure out when the next carriage arrives. That final carriage will take you to the estate. Thank you for your patience-" Towards the end of his statements, you can tell he was reading from a piece of paper, which you hear being put away.

  

Upon exiting the carriage, all of the players who traveled will notice each other, as each of them have arrived at roughly the same time. In this group of carriages, Panaji Shasto also joins the arriving travelers. He traveled a day behind his companions, Caillane and Johnathon, who would have intended to leave the night before, but stayed in hopes of catching Panaji once Caillane also received a letter. The Inn has the exact same layout as described before. However, the players are entering from the back this time, so the bar is on the right, and the tables to the left. For those who are already in Retoria, they will have to figure out to talk to the innkeeper on their own. The previous description of the Inn is also applicable for them, as they likely entered from the front:

“Well, it's yet another standard Travis Inn. The bar is to the left of the entrance towards the back of the Inn, and tables are scattered out in front of it. Stairs are visible through a doorway to the left of the bar. To the back of the inn, a marked door leads out to the ‘Travel’ section of this establishment.”

  

Standard tavern-goers occupy the location virtually around the clock. A dice game plays in the corner, and some city workers enjoy some ale at various times.

  

When the players eventually talk to the innkeeper, they have brief conversations that can be guided as follows.

The innkeeper: 

-   recognizes the group as adventurers, then asks if they are here for the arriving carriage
    
-   tells them that the carriage will arrive in about an hour 
    
-   suggests the spend a little while in the inn to burn time; the Elanor family had payed for the first round of drinks
    

  

If the players hail from Retoria and travel to the inn early, the conversation plays out differently, as the carriage arrives later.

The innkeeper:

-   Recognizes the group as adventurers, then asks if they are here for the arriving carriage
    
-   Tells them that two carriages will be arriving soon, one late at night and the other tomorrow at 12.
    
-   Suggests they come back later, but spend a little while in the inn to burn time; the eleanor family had payed for the first round of drinks
    
-   Suggests whichever carriage they choose, they should rest before it arrives, and if they have business in Retoria, they should wrap it up before leaving.
    

  

If Cahillane and Johnathon are not distracted by someone, they would also burn time waiting at the inn for Panaji. They typically sit in one of the unoccupied corners together. 

  

If the players choose to question the innkeeper, she once again knows little more than what the Elanor family has told her. This includes the route and location where they are being transported to, as well as the reason they are being taken. The innkeeper seems rather thrilled about the whole ordeal, as she thinks it will inspire a new wave of adventurers to help in Bagus. She does however know many of the establishments in Retoria and can point the party towards locations if questioned. 

  

For the next hour and a half, (The carriage is a little late) the players are free to spend time in the inn, or even head into town for a little while. After the hour and a half is up, a dwarven man dressed similarly to the drivers they have already had will enter via the back entrance and briefly talk to the innkeeper. He waits here while a barmaid is fetched to go fetch the party. The barmaid informs the party that the carriage has arrived, and the man who just walked in will be driving them. 

  

Before allowing anyone to leave the inn or enter the carriage, he first checks to make sure they have their letter. Once that is confirmed, he leads the group out to the carriage and explains while walking to and mounting the carriage:

"The estate is about a day out. Luckily for you guys, the mountain way is pretty scenic. It should be an easy ride, as long as you aren't scared of heights. Either way, climb on in the back and get comfortable."

  

##  Part 4: The Encounter

The start of the ride is rather scenic, as promised. However, most of the path is forested. Occasionally though, you catch a beautiful glimpse of the mountainside. A few hours pass, and the sun starts to dip lower into the sky. About 6 hours or so into the ride, the carriage slows to halt. From the front, your driver mutters something before calling out in a gruff voice: "There's a tree in the path guys. I'm going to need your help moving it out of the way enough for us to get by."

  

 Here, Leaf and Flare would wait until they investigate the tree to attack. If the group is all clustered, they would use their banishment scroll on the group immediately. If they aren't clustered, the pair would attack normally and try and lure them into a group. 

  

The banishment spell only affects a 20ft by 20ft circle. Once used, read our paraphrase the following:

“A glowing ring of silver and golden magical energy forms a ring around you 20 feet in the sky. Sparks fly off of the ring before a veil of light starts to descend below it. Please make a dexterity saving throw to escape the ring.”

  

The DC of the spell is 18. Once the spell casts:

“For those who were not hit, the curtain of light fades into an opaque layer of blackness before a bright flash temporarily blinds you. As for the rest, you arrive to the sound of each other breathing in total darkness.”

  

## Part 5: The First Hall

The Angels cannot see in the darkness, except up to five feet. However, they can only move to a player if they can see them, and their moves only activate to nab a player.  
  

“The room you find yourselves in is rather small, barely accommodating the lot of you in width, however, it is rather long. In front of you, an open door leads into another room, and looking behind you, 4 finely crafted marble statues of angels stand in a ring facing one other. You see a plaque next to the angel's with a message on it, and above the angels a dimly glowing crystal illuminates the room. The plaque reads: "Do not cry for the angels, for they will not cry for you."”  
  

Room 2:

“In this room, there is another door (this time closed) to your right, and to your left is a barred portcullis leading into yet another room. A lever is next to the portcullis, and you can see through the bars if you wish to.”

If they look into the portcullis room:

Through the bars, you can see another finely crafted angel statue, with its head in it's palms.

  

## The Loot 

Scattered in the left chest, 50 gold pieces can be collected off of the bottom. Inside of the skull, a blank statuette very akin to the angels in the halls can be grabbed. On the skeleton in one of the rooms, there is a ring of mind shielding with the captured soul of someone who died there.(edited)

  

## Part 6: The Ride 

Once both part 4 and 5 have been dealt with, unconscious players and NPCs should be helped into the cart. Presumable, the tree has been removed from the path at this point. Basically, the aftermath of the event should be dealt with As one of the players wakes up, the legendary line of "Hey, you, you're finally awake..." is delivered. More accurately, the following quote should be read or paraphrased (with allowed interaction in front of the players)

"Hey, you, you're finally awake…

  

Assumedly, some brief conversation would ensue before we fade into "The Dance at Death's Door"  
  

## Rewards

 1. For completing before the dance, all players receive 50 exp.
