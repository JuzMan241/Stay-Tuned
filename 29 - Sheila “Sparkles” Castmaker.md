♀ - 83,8,24

Small childlike human who wears green wizard's robes and a tall wizard's hat. She carries a spellbook with spells written neatly in draconic, and has large round glasses. Sheila always likes to smile no matter the circumstance.

  

She wants to brighten the day of others and help them in whatever small way she can, and loves it when people show gratitude for her help.

She is a little clumsy, and is somewhat awkward. She also has a difficult time noticing when people are not genuine or are using her.
