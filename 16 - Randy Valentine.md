Blond Hair. Blue Eyes. Looks like he has a deal for you. Carries a blank book. Wears well maintained traveler's clothes. Carries a viola on his back.

  

Acts like he has a list of good he sells in his book, when he really just has it all memorized. Never forgets a pretty face, but always remembers the ugly ones.

  

Quest(s):

"[[Sale for Sale]]"

"[[Memories]]"

  

**[[Hello, again]]**. Only if he was sold any cursed items of Rare, or higher, before Hard Reset

Sale for Sale Only if 'Hello, Again' is not active
