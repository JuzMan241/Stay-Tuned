# 8 - Illa

Fighter

Aarakocra

6

â™‚ - 99/80/56

Silver plumage. Meticulously carefully maintained feathers. She has less clothes than most people at the party, but is at least modest.

  

Has a fond love for the unknown. A strong hatred of undead. Wants to see the world.

Naive. Will probably ask if anyone knows someone who makes formal clothing for Aarakocra.
