# 5 - Stumped

The players come across a patch of stumps. A group of trees (about 15 or so) have been chopped just off of the path. In their place, the remains of a campsite (long burnt out embers and coals, some boot marks, as well as a rotted animal hide) are scattered around the area. The campsite was fully cleared though, and nothing else of use can be found among the rotting stumps.
