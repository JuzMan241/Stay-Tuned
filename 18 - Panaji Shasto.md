He sounds smarter than you, if you define intellect by the number of clicking vials and flasks someone has hidden in their gnome-sized tan trench coat.

  

Much like a dog, his small size dictates his energy output.

He's friendly enough, and doesn't mind people looking down on him.

A fine lover of good challenges, strong drinks, and happy company.

Makes and holds his own supply.
