Same height as a normal human, and well built. His fur color is a light tan with black stripes. Wears baggy commoners clothes under leather armor and a dark red cloak. Littering the pockets and belts on his body are common traveling accessories. Waterskins, vials, daggers, rings, chains, and more. He also has golden jewelry piercing his ears, although he usually covers his ears with his cloak. He is often seen sketching in a leather bound book.

  

Not very outgoing, but he is still charismatic when interacted with, although very calculated with his wording. He is also incredibly dedicated to his art, as it is an extension of himself. He would die to protect his book. He also finds exploiting idiots as a fun way to destress.

Has a photographic memory, and is a fantastic listener. He often stalks interesting people to discover their secrets and who they are, and then documents this via his book. He is a very talented artist. 

He hates uselessness. If someone cannot control their own life, he will.
