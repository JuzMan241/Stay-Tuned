## Intelligence Homebrew
At character creation, the intelligence modifier of a PC also acts as a modifier to the number of known proficiencies. For example, if a PC were to have an intelligence modifier of +2, they would gain two proficiencies of their choice. These can be weapon, armor, tool, skill, or language proficiencies. These cannot be used to buy saving throw proficiencies.
