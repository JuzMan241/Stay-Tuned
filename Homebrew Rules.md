# Homebrew Rules
---

## Intelligence Homebrew
At character creation, the intelligence modifier of a PC also acts as a modifier to the number of known proficiencies. For example, if a PC were to have an intelligence modifier of +2, they would gain two proficiencies of their choice. These can be weapon, armor, tool, skill, or language proficiencies. These cannot be used to buy saving throw proficiencies. 
Expertise can be purchased using these points for skills one is already proficient in. Upgrading a normal skill to expertise in this way costs two points of your modifier bonus.

## Overlapping Proficiency Homebrew
At character creation, proficiencies a character has managed to acquire twice can, instead of being nullified, be used in two options.
A. The overlapping proficiency is instead upgraded to expertise.
B. The overlapping proficiency can stay as a proficiency, and the player can choose to gain an additional proficiency of similar type. Ex. Proficiency in thieves tools twice could become proficency in thieves tools AND playing cards.

## Temporary HP Overlapping
Instead of temporary HP being replaced by any new amount, temporary HP can be added onto, up to a maximum of twice the added amount.
For example, if a character with 7 THP recieves an additional 5 THP, their new maximum is 10 THP and would this recieve 3 THP, bringing them to 10.
