## Missing Man

### Introduction 

After the disappearance of Milo's husband, Allen, Milo attempts to find her husband by employing the help of anyone willing.

  

### Background 

On day 1 of The Dance at Death's Door, Milo's husband was captured and killed. Allen separated from Milo while in the hedge-maze, and the two got lost. However, Allen is captured after separating, but Milo isn't too worried at first and searches for her husband. When he doesn't come to the room that night, Milo is very worried and confused. By the next morning, she gave up searching and is just drinking to pass time. Milo is a changeling, so she may think someone was trying to capture her because of that and they got Allen by mistake. However, she will not reveal this unless absolutely necessary as she trusts few people.

  

### Synopsis

Milo keeps drinking in the dining room until the players arrive. Milo would offer to buy a drink for one of the players, and inform them of her circumstance. Milo wants help searching for him or figuring out where he went. The quest is considered complete once her husband is found.(edited)

  

### Part 1: Second Day Dining 

After not seeing or hearing her husband come back to his room the previous night, Milo would attempt to get food in the morning. She gets some wine with her meal, and this drink turns into many. Because she went to bed early last night (to wait for Allen), Milo also wakes up early in order to get her breakfast. She basically wakes up with the servants. By the time the players are having their first meal, Milo is likely already tipsy. On top of not being well-rested, Milo would definitely stand out for this. Milo's seat is near the kitchen, so she is capable of hearing orders. If the players order food or approach her, then Milo would offer to buy them a drink in order to listen to her speak for a little bit. If the players entertain her, she would make sure to cover the following in the conversation:

-   Her husband disappeared yesterday. 
    
-   She accidentally fell asleep while waiting for him in the hedge maze. After her nap, she looked around for him in the hedge maze, and he wasn't there. 
    
-   She spent all of last night searching around the estate for him, before heading back to her room to wait for him. 
    
-   She wants help looking for her husband because now she is worried since he didn't come to the room last night. 
    
-   She knows he wouldn't run off or anything, but has absolutely no idea where he went.
    

  

Due to her level of intoxication, any persuasion or deception rolls against Milo have advantage.

  

### Part 2: The Plan 

Milo's method of search is very flexible depending on how the conversation goes. She is very open to following any of the party's suggestions, however, she would at least try to persuade them to assist her with searching in a conventional method. One successful persuasion roll is enough to convince her otherwise. If the players promise to assist her in her plan, then she would thank the party before gathering her things and setting them in her room. Afterward, she would begin searching for her husband as the developed plan prescribes. Once the players find her husband, the quest is completed. The players do not have to tell Milo anything to complete the quest, all though they would not get any reward from her without telling her.

  

###  Rewards:

1.  Milo would give the players her glamourweave cloak as thanks.
2.  Milo is inclined to help anyone involved in the future, and is willing to give them one favor.
3.  All involved players gain 50 exp for helping.
