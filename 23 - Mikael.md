Sorcerer

Half-Elf

â™‚ - 33,57,16

Shorter than most humans. Is always smirking confidently, and his arms are strewn with pattern tattoos. Pairs common clothes with a long black duster. Stores things on his belt instead of having a backpack.

  

"Look, if I'm not here, who knows what could go wrong."

Mikael is confident and overprotective. He follows his friends ensuring they don't get into trouble. He always watches out for his friends, but often forgets to ensure his own wellbeing; he is a bit forgetful.

Can be bossy if things go wrong. Despises non-magical animals as they are unpredictable. However, he has a familiar cat.
