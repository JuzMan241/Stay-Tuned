# 48 - Tome of Secrets

Barbarian

Tabaxi

19

Gender ￦^/´¡~/%#

Fur as black as the void, with smiling yellow eyes. The tabaxi before barely caught your gaze as you looked about the room. Their attire seems lacking in style, and probably old.

  

Lover of knowledge and trader of stories. Fan of drow, knows too much about them. Despises to be alone.
