## 3F - Caillane Crystal 

Caillanne's backpack and traveling supplies are laid neatly at the foot of her bed. In her backpack, there are 9 rations and 7 gold. 

At the bottom of the backpack, a small wooden box is mostly empty except for some sheets of paper, some ink, and a pen. On one of the papers, it had begun being written... “Dear John”
