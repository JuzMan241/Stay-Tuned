# 2 - Elusive Rapids

The DM should ask one player to roll perception (other player's passives still apply). Succeeding a DC 14 perception check, they can identify the sounds of a nearby river in the direction that would place the river closest to that player. Upon failing, they should be roughly told, 

"you thought you heard something, but the sound seems to have disappeared."
