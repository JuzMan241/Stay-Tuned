Dear Mother,

I hope this letter finds you and Da in good health. It has been a while since I have been somewhere long enough to write, and I'm sorry I haven't been able to sooner. Just know that I'm safe. 

I have finally made it to Lissos. As I write this, I am sitting the one of the coziest taverns I've been in yet watching the rain drum against the cobblestones outside. The food is good and the drink is welcome after a hard day's walk to reach this town on the coast. I shall have to ask the barkeep for the recipe for his spiced cider to send home. I know Da would love it. Ha ha! 

Tomorrow, I shall seek out the local guilds for work. I have nary an inkling of what kind of job they could have for me, but I'm eager to prove myself. Maybe it'll be hunting some beast in the woods near by, or guarding something important? Yes, Mother, I promise to be careful when I can. If I can manage, I plan on staying here as a home base for a time. Here, at least, the courier riders have a station and drop box for mail, which will make writing home more consistent. 

The people here seem nice so far. Given the trade that runs through town, they must be used to strangers coming through. Perhaps I can find a friend or two here? I will try to, for travel has been awfully lonely for a while now. That being my only complaint about setting out on my journey so far. 

In short, I am far from home, and I'm alright. Give my best wishes to Da and Henry, and give Lilly a belly rub for me when you can, to let her know I miss her 

Love,
Lyra
