# 2 - Hidden Shrine

There is a reason some things have been hidden. Want to find out why?

"Shrouded by bushes and trees, you can make out the tips of 3 stone pillars." 

Upon approaching, the party can see that 3 stone pillars surround a stone platform. The pillars were once cut to a precise shape, but have since been eroded and covered with vines. In the middle of the platform between the pillars, a silver sword stands upright, inserted into a holding slot in the ground. Upon lifting the sword out of its holder, the wielder is teleported into the sunless world.

  

Dropping the sword in the sunless world drops the sword in the material plane. Placing the sword back into the holder brings all people in the sunless world back into the material plane.
