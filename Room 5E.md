## 5E - Gnome Technician 

An Explorer's pack sits on the bed, its contents rather messily falling out. On the table, a large sack of components and scrap pieces of metal, wood, and some fabrics takes up the majority of the table. Ayajel keeps three component pouches on him, but he only has three gold coins in his explorer's pack. There is also an extra dagger in his backpack. 

Ayajel is rather protective of his things, and will set alarm on his door at night.
