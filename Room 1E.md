## 1E - Naissana 

A backpack is thrown on the bed during the day, and stored under the bed while Naissana sleeps. In the center of the table, three unlit candles are arranged in a triangle, and a staff leans against one of the chairs. 6 gold and 8 rations are stuffed into their backpack. In their backpack, a small (locked box) contains a blood-stained pendant and some unlegible shorthand, which if taken time to translate will give insight into "Trail of Blood".
