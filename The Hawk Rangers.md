### 3 - The Hawk Rangers

Mappo ♂

Very small kobold with red scales and orange eyes. Wears a green shirt and hood as well as green-blue leather gear. His tail and horns poke out through his gear. He carry a shortbow that is too big for them and a dagger which is just his size. Instead of shoes, he has wraps around his feet. 

  

Mappo is chipper, excitable, and likes to make his friends (the other people and animals in the party) happy by obeying their commands. He rarely questions the commands of his friends and doesn't see their way of life as wrong in the slightest. Mappo enjoys a good time and will often play with their victims when caught. Mappo is rather young. Meppo is his sister.

Meppo ♀

Small kobold with red scales and turquoise eyes. She wears a muddy green shirt and muddy-brown leather gear. Her right horn has a gold necklace twisted around it. Both her horns and tail poke out of her gear. She carries a shortsword that is a little to big for them and a dagger that is just about right. Instead of shoes, she has wraps around her feet. 

  

Meppo is usually a serious person, but sometimes has difficulty staying that way when around her brother. Meppo adores her brother and places his safety above all else.
