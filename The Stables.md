The stables contain corrals for 8 horses. The stables are set up to have 4 corrals on either side of a large walkway. The corrals and walkway are all closed in by a tall roof and a fence gate leading to the horse track. Opposite the fence gate, a step up leads to the separate part of the building on a stone foundation. This area has two rooms opposite each other in a small hallway. The door to these two rooms are typically locked, as they are the sleeping quarters of the horse-masters. The hallway for the rooms leads to the main door of the building. The main door of the building is on a large porch that wraps around much of the structure. This porch has ample seating, and even has a table with a game set up on it. The trail from the mansion leads to the porch.
