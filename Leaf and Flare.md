## <details> <summary>Fallen Leaf </summary><p>Ace with Crimson Hair  </p> </details>  

Male/Female tabaxi with very well kept fur, incredibly soft and well maintained to an obsessive degree, especially for someone who probably lives in the woods. They wear a hooded cloak and shorts that properly accent their Autumn-Colored fur with red silk. 

Their Changeling form has long, crimson-dyed hair and stands at 5'10" tall. 

Openly flirtatious and whimsical. Loves a pretty face, and enjoys witty company. Always makes sure they know where Kyt is before they try flirting with someone. Will fight without honor if they don't like someone.
