Elena Phoenix

Ranger

Human

19

♀ - 57/25/4

A flame-patterned cape is draped over rather expensive-looking attire of similar design . She is pale ginger hair and amber eyes shine like fire. Tomboy-ish build.

  

She always seems a bit on edge, despite her cheery disposition. Orc sympathizer. Wants to set herself apart from the world as someone worth following.

A firm believer in the Golden Rule.

Is afraid. Is always afraid. Will smile for everyone else's sake.
