Small built tiefling with white eyes and rather straight horns. They wear a black jacket with a fur hood over leather armor. A belt holds a dagger and pouch and a lute is slung from his back. Black boots.

Somewhat shy and very agreeable, but likes to spend time with interesting people and enjoys the company of his friends. Is rather nice to everyone, but tries to keep himself and his party away from "troublemakers" as best he can. Was "bullied" into coming to the party by Iorgar.

Was convinced to come to the party by Iorgar and intends to protect/watch over his party members very carefully during the party.
