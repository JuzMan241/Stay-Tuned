Firm believer that all sentient life has -worth. Avoids eating meat by habit, but doesn't shy away from it if offered directly. Despises confusion and arguments about what should be obvious and will often bottle up stress. Greatly prefers the company of people who don't question his beliefs, but tries to respect even the most foolish.
