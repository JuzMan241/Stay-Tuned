**Frenzy, (3/3).** The creature can gain 1d6+3 temporary hitpoints for 12 hours by expending a charge of frenzy as a bonus action. The creature can have up to three charges stored at any time. Devouring the head of a dead humanoid regains one charge of frenzy.

**Hunger.** This creature cannot regain hitpoints from long or short rests. Whenever this creature performs a long rest, all remaining temporary hit points heal the creature in HP. If the creatures has zero charges of frenzy during it's long rest, the creature loses 1d6+3 hitpoints instead of healing. If it drops below zero health this way, the creature dies.
