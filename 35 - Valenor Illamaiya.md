Sorcerer

High-Elf

97

â™‚ - 39,58,63

Wears an extravagant white fur-trimmed cloak over gold accented white apparel. He also wears gold jewelry and long black boots. A fancy rapier always rests at his hip.

  

Feels entitled to the respect of others, and will get angry if denied that. Likes to boast off of the assumption that they are the most cunning and intelligent person in any room. Challenges any accusations against them and puts others down to validate his own position.

They are genuinely kind to people who have never wronged him, and children who don't know better. Condescending to everyone.

Valenor has a servant named Miya who is attending as a plus one to the party. Miya is rather shy, but also very loyal to Valenor. When Valenor dies, she will find someone else to follow.
