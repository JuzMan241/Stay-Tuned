#### Main Dining Room

The main dining room connects directly to the kitchen, much like a fastfood line. However, food is still done by order much like a restaurant. After ordering food, the person behind the counter will ask them to keep their number face up on the table so the server can find them. 

Roll 8d52, as all [[The Party List|party members]] would eventually come into the dining room.
