## 6D - Milo Vix 

A rapier hangs off of one of the chairs in the room. In this same chair, there is a backpack with light traveling supplies, a disguise kit, and 4 rations. A pouch of 14 gold rests on the table near the backpack. 

Before the end of night one, this room will be empty and unused. After, it will have Allen's item's stored here as well as the above inventory.
