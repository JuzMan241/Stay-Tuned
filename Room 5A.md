## 5A - Kuyoko "Kuyo" Shinimiya 

A backpack is neatly laid against the bed frame. 32 gold in the backpack, alongside the other parts of an explorer's pack. Stores a katana under the bed. 

The bed is always made. Kuyo typically spends time meditating or sharpening his katana before going, but will politely investigate anything that interrupts him.
