# The Dance At Death's Door

## The Dance At Death's Door

### Background

Some of the Elanor family have plans to sacrifice individuals on each day of the party. Each day, the players will have opportunities to interact with guests, and will be given gradually more information until they unravel the dance at death's door.

  

### Synopsis

#### Day 1

Kuyo and Allen Vix share conversation in the hedge maze before Kuyo leaves. Allen Vix is captured in the hedge maze, and taken to be killed in the sacrifice room. 

Iorgar finds the hidden path in the hedge maze, and follows the tunnel after running ahead of Sykkuno. Sykkuno follows Iorgar, and overhears Iorgar being threatened and given the dancer's deal. This starts Sykunno's "[[Deal Breaker]]" quest line. 

The players are dropped off in the plaza, where they have an informative conversation with sebastian. Once the players are in the ballroom, (or at least most of them), the organizer of the party gives their speech, and the players are free to have fun at the resort.

  

#### Day 2 

On Day 2, Milo Vix is annoyed that Allen didn't come to their room last night, and worries about where he went. This starts the quest "[[Missing Man]]" and is the first chance the players have to unravel the dance. 

Wang Xiao is also killed fairly early in the day after visiting the hedge maze. 

Later, Kuyo may have gone back to the hedge maze and met Colmax there. The two start the maze together, and Kuyo tries to find Colmax again who stumbled into the aqueducts. He is late and only overhears part of the deal, before quickly escaping into the hedge maze again to avoid suspicion. 

  

#### Day 3 

At the start of day 3, Valenor is sacrificed per request of Colmax. This would start "[[A Bad Trade]]" and "[[Lost Puppy]]". 

After Valenor is sacrificed, Ardorim gets caught in the sacrifice area, and convinces the warlocks to spare him and one other person on day 4 (of which they planned not to kill anyone anyway) in return for his silence. 

Around midday, Kuyo would run into Johnathon and begin to trust him. He would then invite him into what he knows. Kuyo and Johnathon later find that they were too late when the host gives a speech that Valenor is missing.

  

#### Day 4

After Valenor is killed, Johnathon would seek extra help and inform the players and his party. 

All the family members come home on day four, and they throw a large celebration for the new years upstairs.

  

#### Day 5

Both Silvia Woods and Alice Black are killed, as they are both looking for Valenor. 

Lucky Break and Columbine join the dancer's deal.

  

#### Day 6

Sheila would be sacrificed on day 6. 

Klialtocmardoth becomes part of the deal today as well.

  

#### Day 7

The Followers come after the party.

## Estate Overview

From the outside, the mansion is visually divided into three sections. The left and right sections mirror one another, acting as wings of the middle. The middle section is elegantly carved out of a similar stone to that of the plaza. The door sits in a large archway, directly under a balcony on the second story. The two wings of the mansion sprout up from a stone foundation, with the first floor being lined by a series of windows. The second story's windows are spaced much farther apart, and the entire second floor is divided from the main building by yet another, albeit large, balcony. And lastly there is one more balcony, well four of them, on both floors on the farthest-most point on each side of the wings. 

  

All of the hallways of the mansion are lined with large ornate vases. These vases are spaced uniformly apart (about 12 feet), with a candle holder above each vase. The candle holder has a candle in it, but it sheds magical light. The vases and lights are only ever on one side of the hallway. 1 random coin is hidden with each vase. 

Rules for rolling what coin are as follows:

> 1 is copper
> 2 is silver
> 3 is electrum
> 4 is gold
> 5 is platinum

The trails outside are all lined with stylish tiki-torches, all about 20 ft apart, and are shaded by light tree cover. Many parts of the estate are lightly forested, but nearly all the paths (except the one leading out to the cliffside) are forested. Specific places have their descriptions written under "[[The Elanor Estate]] [(Google)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UChJraCjcgd7qAyQy-qsnKn7lA0h5G1VFZi2mBFq6rc/edit#bookmark=id.e9puhcdjk0ao)”.

## The First Day

### Approaching The Estate

The first day of the party starts with our adventurers arriving late to the scene after their brief interruption. Luckily for them, the rest of the ride has no interruptions as a pleasant breeze picks and the baring heat of the sun starts to die down as it dips into the horizon. As the carriage finally pulls up the mountain to the plateau of the Elanor estate, the players arrive in the evening (about 6). A passive perception above twelve would also notice the horse trail passing through the main road somewhere along the way. The first thing they see as they approach the mansion would be the large plaza, which has a fountain in the center of it. Both the plaza and the fountain are made of a white stone. The fountain has two spouts, each out of a regal wolf, standing at attention towards the entrance path of the estate. The plaza is surrounded by grass hedges, and an open gate through the hedges leads to two paths either side of the plaza. The plaza is large enough for an entire cart to fit comfortably between the fountain and it's edge. As such, the carts would park in line, the first to the right of the entrance to the mansion itself, leaving enough space for the adventurers to get off.

###  Papers, Please

The main door in front of the plaza leads directly into the ballroom. To the left of the door, there is a well equipped guard with a silver and blue shirt over his chain-mail armor, and on the right, Sebastian stands waiting for the arriving group. Sebastian needs to have a conversation with the arriving party, so they can inform them where their room is, and that they need to attend the speech that night. 

#### [[The Player’s Rooms (Legacy)]]

### The Speech

Once our players (or at the very least most of them) enter the ballroom, Robert would stand from a chair near the doorway to the dining room, pick up a glass and start clinking it with a spoon to gather the attention of the ballroom.

  

Once he is finished, read or paraphrase the following:
> 
> The man in the doorway begins to speak:  
> "Welcome everyone, to the Elanor estate! From me and the rest of our family, we are glad that you could make it to join us in celebrating the new year. We hope you will enjoy the festivities here, but before you properly begin your vacation, we should probably cover a few basics'' The man takes a sip from his glass of wine. 
> 
> "As many of you have already figured out, you will need your letter and number in order to get food for yourself and any plus one you may have brought. We've shipped in quite a large amount of inventory, so please, don't let it go to waste. Another thing, this resort doesn't have a curfew, but don't expect there to be much service past midnight. Most of our staff stay on a diurnal sleep schedule." 
> 
> "And lastly, we at the Elanor estate put together a light-hearted game for you more competitive folk. Hidden around the grounds of this estate, there are seven cats. There are maps outside, by the way. You may have seen one coming in." While speaking, he takes a white porcelain cat off of the table next to him and holds it up so it is visible. 
> 
> "With each of these cats comes a trait, which you can find by petting its head. The goal is to come to either me or my co-host with the names of all seven traits, and where you found them." He gestures to the woman at his side. 
> 
> "If you have the correct combinations, then we will post your name to the leaderboard in the dining room containing the order of victors. We hope this little game of ours will inspire something in all of you." 
> 
> The man finishes his statement with a smile. 
> 
> "This, leads me to the reason we are gathered here..."
> 
> "From whatever walk of life you come from, there's one thing that drew you here today, surrounded by all these strangers in a ballroom with enough drinks that some of you think I'm speaking through water right now." 
> 
> The host takes a sip of their wine before continuing. 
> 
> "You were invited. You were proven to be part of a finer cut of people. A much higher class of capabilities than the common smith, or hunter. The type of person who one day will listen to strangers telling stories with your name in them. Whether you'll be a hero, a victim, or a king who tried their best, you share a spark of strength seen many times before." 
> 
> They catch their breath with another sip of wine to give the crown time to let the words sink in. 
> 
> "This is why we've called you to our estate. Why we invited you to this week away from the troubles of life back home. To make your impression in history, as many have before you. To socialize with the other guests around you. To make sure that when you succeed in what you set out to do, all of your stories will be intertwined in something beautiful." 
> 
> They down the rest of the drink. 
> 
> "If you need us, we'll be around, but otherwise, the servants are instructed to take care of you. So please, all of you, have fun, talk with each other, and please don't invite the servants to your rooms." The host and co hosts then begin walking into the dining room.

After their speech, the host would probably make his way to the private kitchen to eat.

  

### The Game 

The host (#1) and his wife, (#2) will be enjoying each other's company in the ballroom before they make their end of the day speech each day. This would be the easiest time to talk to them about the leader boards. 

In each of the seven locations, there is a small porcelain cat, painted red and white. The cat looks content with its hands reaching up to its head. Petting the cat whispers the corresponding word to the one who pet it. Only the one who pet the cat can hear the whisper. Each of the cats also have a number on the bottom.

If they attempt to break the cats, they have an AC of 25 with 3 hit points. The cat takes three less damage from all sources. The location of each trait is listed below.

  

#### C is for cat

##### (1) The Cliff - Courage 

A cyan cat stands majestically, staring out over the edge of the cliff. It may be dangerous to pet it. Whether your character recognizes that is up to you. 

##### (2) The Maze - Cunning 

A bright pink cat is smirking at you from the ground in the dead end. The fact that you found it means you are lost, and it knows this, despite not being alive. 

##### (3) The Gardens - Creativity 

A dark green cat stands on its hind legs, balanced by its tail. It's forepaws hold a white rose to the sky. The rose is also made of porcelain. 

##### (4) The Range - Confidence 

An orange cat is crouching down behind a target, hidden from the common area of fire, ready to pounce, if it wasn't made of porcelain. 

##### (5) The Ballroom - Charm 

This cat is white, and sits plainly on a table near the doorway into the dining room. It looks happy. 

##### (6) The Library - Curiosity 

A lavender cat sits on the shelves, it looks down at a book under its paws. It is 'reading' about cats. 

##### (7) The Stables - Compassion 

A bright yellow cat stands on a table at the end of the stables. It stares forward with a peculiar intensity.

  

#### [[Sparkles]] [(Google)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Nd4bhUif4wMTRWc0uk1AzdesThkDUIebr3ON_ZaZn0/edit#bookmark=id.ghyjewyrvnwd) 

After hearing about the game, Sheila is immediately captivated by the idea of finding all the cats. Should the players meet or interact with her, she would ask for help in the endeavor to win the game, as well as offer her assistance. Should the players take her up on this offer, then the quest "Sparkles" shall start. 

  

### Day 1 Exploration 

From here, nothing new happens on day 1. Should the players choose to explore the estate before going to sleep, they will have a little bit of time, say 3 hours, before the services start becoming unavailable. However, the kitchen/bar is always open.

  

## The Second Day

### [[Missing Man]] [(Google)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Nd4bhUif4wMTRWc0uk1AzdesThkDUIebr3ON_ZaZn0/edit#bookmark=id.k8l6kab6vmzn) 

On Day 2, [[37 - (Ada) Milo Vix|Milo]]'s quest "[[Missing Man]]" begins. The players can start the quest by talking with Milo, and listening to her complaints about her husband's disappearance. For practically all of day 2, [[37 - (Ada) Milo Vix|Milo]] will be spending a large majority of time in the main dining room, drinking a large sum of alcohol. The details of this quest can be found under "[[Missing Man]]" in [[Smaller Stories|smaller stories]].

  

### [[Tour of the Underworld]] [(Google)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSTaEZttZ_PhqdD0GTumzRpcUCdLjTovNJ-OE1FS9Cg/edit#bookmark=id.r77890na34ur) 

Today is also the day that [[43 - Erarith “Era” Kenep|Erarith]] would begin with his testing of the drug. Today, should any players interact with him, he will now be much more sociable, and try inviting players to his room or some other secluded location. This would start the quest "[[Tour of the Underworld]]".
