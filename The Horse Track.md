#### Horse Track

The trail is very clear cut and easy to follow (as well as being very scenic). The only difficulty in horse handling would be attempting to ride the horse quickly. This would require an easy animal handling check of DC 8 to ensure nothing goes wrong. Riding with an instructor would eliminate this risk.
