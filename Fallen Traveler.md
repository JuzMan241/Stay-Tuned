# 1 - Fallen Traveler

"Sometimes, I just like to lie down, and feel like garbage, care to join me?"

"A fallen adventurer rests by your path ahead; they don't appear to be moving." 

If you approach them, they look at you, with pleading eyes, before falling unconscious. You see no visible wounds, but a medicine check of 10 reveals that they are dead, and 15 reveals a lot of internal injuries.
