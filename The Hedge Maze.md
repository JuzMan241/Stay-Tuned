#### Hedge Maze

In the front of the hedge maze, a sign reads, "Beware the small dogs, for they are not trained." The center of the hedge maze has a three person bench directly opposite a curled up direwolf that is sleeping on the ground. The direwolf is friendly, and likes to sleep and greet people in the hedge-maze. The center area is layed with gray brick. In order to notice something is amiss in the area leading to the aqueducts, a DC 17 perception check (Or passive perception of +7) is required. Actually finding the entrance at this point requires only a DC 12 investigation check. Failing this check only reveals that the bushes were disturbed, which is why something seemed off.
